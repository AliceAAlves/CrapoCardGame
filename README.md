# CrapoCardGame
Unity project

Created by: Alice Alves

Card game called Crap√¥ implemented on Unity (C#)
Screen frames can be found in "00 About", including a pdf explaining the rules of the game.

To play click on the card you wish to move, and when selected (highlighted yellow) click on where you'd wish to move it. If the card does not become highlighted, it means it cannot be selected/played at that moment. Click on the deck to draw new card. Each player takes turns playing the game. The game shows which player's turn it is.
